		story: `
Once upon a time, in a serene village nestled close to a dark forest, there lived a young shepherd boy named Rahul. His days were spent tending to his master's sheep, finding little excitement in the routine of his duties. With only his loyal dog for company and his shepherd's pipe for amusement, Rahul often yearned for something more thrilling to occupy his time.

One day, as Rahul sat amidst the tranquil pasture, his mind wandered to thoughts of adventure. Contemplating what he would do if a wolf were to appear, he devised a mischievous plan to break the monotony of his days.

Recalling his master's advice to call for help should a wolf threaten the flock, Rahul saw an opportunity for amusement. With a mischievous grin, he decided to play a prank on the villagers. With all his might, he cried out, "Wolf! Wolf!"

True to his expectations, the villagers, upon hearing his frantic cries, abandoned their tasks and rushed to the pasture in a frenzy. However, upon reaching the scene, they found Rahul doubled over with laughter, reveling in the success of his trickery.

Undeterred by the villagers' chagrin, Rahul repeated his prank a few days later, once again invoking the villagers' aid with false alarms of a wolf's presence.

Yet, as the sun dipped behind the forest one fateful evening, casting long shadows over the pasture, a real wolf emerged from the underbrush, poised to strike at the unsuspecting sheep.

In a panic, Rahul dashed towards the village, his voice echoing with genuine terror as he cried, "Wolf! Wolf!" Though the villagers heard his plea, their trust in Rahul had been eroded by his previous deceit. "He cannot deceive us again," they muttered, refusing to heed his call for help.

Tragically, the wolf savaged a large number of Rahul's sheep, leaving devastation in its wake.

The moral of the story remains unchanged: liars, even when speaking the truth, are not believed.

		story: `Once upon a time, in a serene village nestled amidst verdant fields, there dwelled a farmer named Kisanlal and his cherished family. Among their modest possessions was a remarkable hen that bestowed upon them a single golden egg each day, a treasure that sustained them with its modest bounty.

	However, Kisanlal's ambitions soared beyond the meager comforts provided by the daily golden egg. Enthralled by the allure of instant wealth, he devised a cunning plan to seize all the golden eggs at once.
	
	One fateful morning, as the hen tenderly laid its customary golden egg, Kisanlal's heart swelled with greed. Disregarding the bond they shared, he grasped a knife and callously ended the hen's life, convinced that within its form lay a fortune beyond measure.
	
	Yet, as he eagerly dissected the lifeless creature, Kisanlal was met with a sobering truth. No gleaming treasures adorned the hen's innards, only the stark reminder of his folly in the form of crimson blood staining its feathers. Regret gnawed at his conscience as he grappled with the consequences of his rash actions.
	
	Once content with the modest blessings bestowed by the hen, Kisanlal now found himself ensnared in the web of his own desires. Each passing day bore witness to the erosion of his wealth, leaving him impoverished and bereft of the comforts he once took for granted.
	
	In the aftermath of his misguided pursuit, Kisanlal gleaned a poignant lesson: true abundance resides not in the pursuit of ephemeral riches, but in the embrace of gratitude for life's simple blessings. With a contrite heart and humbled spirit, he resolved to cherish each day as a gift and forsake the siren call of unchecked ambition.
	
	And so, amidst the echoes of his folly, Kisanlal embarked on a journey of redemption, guided by the timeless wisdom that true wealth springs from the richness of a grateful heart`,
